          <h2 >Our Journey</h2>
          <p >
            News Bus started as a college project, driven by the vision to
            simplify the way people access news. In this digital era, where
            information is scattered across different websites, we wanted to
            create a unified space for news enthusiasts. Whether you're
            interested in current affairs, entertainment, general knowledge,
            health, science, or technology, News Bus has you covered.
