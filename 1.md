It seems that the `darkMode` prop is consistently being logged as `false` in both `App.js` and `AboutUs.js`. This indicates that the issue is likely not with the prop passing itself, but rather with how the `darkMode` state is being managed in your application.

Let's troubleshoot further:

1. **State Initialization:**
   Check how the initial state of `darkMode` is set in the `App.js` component. Ensure that it is not inadvertently set to `false` initially if you expect it to be `true`. For example, in the constructor or wherever you initialize state:

   ```jsx
   state = {
     darkMode: true, // or whatever your default should be
   };
   ```

2. **Check `toggledarkMode` Function:**
   Verify that the `toggledarkMode` function is correctly toggling the `darkMode` state. Here's the function from your code:

   ```jsx
   toggledarkMode = () => {
     this.setState((prevState) => ({
       darkMode: !prevState.darkMode,
     }));
   };
   ```

   Confirm that calling `toggledarkMode` updates the state as expected.

3. **Conditional Styling:**
   In your components (`NavBar` and `AboutUs`), ensure that you are using the `darkMode` prop correctly to conditionally apply styles. For example:

   ```jsx
   const theme = {
     color: darkMode ? 'white' : 'black',
     backgroundColor: darkMode ? 'black' : 'white',
   };
   ```

   Check that these styles are applied to relevant elements in both components.

4. **Check for Side Effects:**
   Look for any side effects or asynchronous code that might be affecting the state. Make sure that there are no asynchronous operations that could interfere with the state updates.

5. **Manifest Error:**
   The error related to the Manifest and the icon might not be directly related to the `darkMode` issue. However, it's worth addressing. Ensure that the paths to your icons in the manifest file are correct and that the icons are accessible.

If, after checking these points, the issue persists, consider providing more of your code, especially the sections related to state management, and I'll do my best to assist you further.
